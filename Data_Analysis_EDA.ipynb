        "# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
        "is a crucial step in the data analysis process that involves summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, often with the help of statistical and graphical techniques. Advanced EDA techniques can help you uncover hidden patterns, relationships, and insights within your data. In this guide, I'll walk you through advanced EDA methods, scenarios, and tips and tricks, explaining them in great detail.\n",
